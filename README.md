## Architecture

* **UI Layer:**
  Built with `Tkinter` and `tkinterdnd2` for a clean main interface and intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.
* **Logic Layer:**
  Supports group management (add/delete groups), batch add/delete/paste/drag executables (`.exe`/`.lnk`).
* **Persistence:**
  Software group and path data are automatically saved to a local file `apps_groups.json`.
* **Batch Launch:**
  One-click to launch all programs in the current group, with automatic handling of executables and shortcuts.
* **Dependencies:**
  Relies only on Python standard library and `tkinterdnd2`; optionally, `pywin32` for shortcut (`.lnk`) parsing.
